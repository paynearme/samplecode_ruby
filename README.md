# PaynearmeCallbacks

This is a starting point for integrating your service with PayNearMe's callback
system. Provided in this project is a framework for handling incoming callbacks
from PayNearMe and constructing the appropriate response. Each callback method
includes an example implementation.

This package serves as a starting point for integrating paynearme callbacks
into your existing ruby application stack. It is an example implementation
and leaves implementation details up to the end user (you).
